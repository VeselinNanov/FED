          We had to create a logo design, however I have decided to do a whole
          branding of a startup eco coffee shop company.
          <br /><br />
          I have learnt how to do a whole branding project. I watched a lot of
          videos and had to put those skills to use. Therefore I put my
          Photoshop and Illustrator skills to use and I had to create the logo
          and the mockups for the branding project. I expanded my Illustrator
          skills, as I haven’t had a lot of opportunities to work with it, but
          now I feel extremely inspired to create more projects.

          We had to create a personal photography portfolio with different
          styles of photography.
          <br /><br />
          In this project I have learnt that I need to be on time. My background
          in photography helped me a lot, however I used to work with an older
          camera and I have never touched a macro lens, which was an amazing
          experience and I took so many cool shots with it. I also learnt how
          InDesign works, but couldn’t really dive into it and learn more about
          it. Definitely putting it in my list of adobe apps to learn.

          We have to create a video documentary with a team.
          <br /><br />
          This project was extremely hard for me. I am used to be behind the
          camera, while taking all the shots, however this time I was voted lead
          actor for the documentary. This has been really hard for me as I am
          not really confident enough in myself and I definitely do not like how
          I look on camera. But when we started shooting I had the greatest
          time. As a team we had our differences in our time management, however
          we tooks some really funny shots and I hope the result will be just as
          funny or just as cringe.
