        <h2>SPRINT 1-3</h2>
        <p>
          SPRINT 1-3: We had to start working on the team building. We also had
          to get to know the client and so we had a lot of meetings on what we
          need to do and come up with a moodboard and write the things we want
          to create on our website, We have a unique feature called a
          songbuilder and the client really liked it. We also had to the
          research part of the project and the basic wireframes.
          <br /><br />
          I have learnt how to do a lot of research, tend to needs of the client
          and get used to the team. We also learnt how to work as a group.

        <h2>SPRINT 3-6</h2>
        <p>
          SPRINT 3-6: In the sprint we started working on the design. It has
          been quite challenging to create more designs and come up with just
          one. We also had to finish up the presentation and the things we have
          done.
          <br /><br />
          I have leant that team working is a big part of a project we are all
          passionate about. It has been quite a journey, but I am happy with
          what I have accomplished in this project.
