          This is my personal development website. In here I will present what I
          have been doing and working on the past 18 weeks of Semester 2 for
          Front End Development, Media Production and UX/UCD Design.

            UX/UCD was one of the subjects that did not really interest me in the beginning. However, after realising how important it is, I started enjoying it a lot more and right now it is one of my favourite subjects. Click the button to see more of my UX/UCD journey.

            Throughout the semester, Media was one of the subjects I had previous background in. It was really fun to work on a branding assignmentm, create a photography portfolio and finally make a video documentary with my team.

            For Project, my and I had to create a website for a client. We researched, designed, coded together. With a few exceptions we were all a team and we created the final version of the website. I was mostly active during the research phase of the project and the designing.

        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
          I am a 19 year old student at the Fontys University of Applied
          Science. I have recently moved here to the Netherlands and it's been
          quite a journey living on my own and having a lot of responsibilities.
          I have been getting used to everything and it has been quite hard, but
          I am sure I will manage with everything.
