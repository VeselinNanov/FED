        <h2>WEEK 1</h2>
        <p>
          In week 1 we got introduced to what User Centered Design is. We did a
          workshop and we asked a lot of questions. We also had to write a short
          text on how we see ourselves in the future as UX/UCD designers. <br />
          <br />
          This definitely helped me with understanding the difference between
          what UCD and what UX is and get an insight on what we are going to do
          for the rest of the semester.

        <h2>WEEK 2</h2>
        <p>
          In week two we learned how to create an empathy map and what are the
          applications of it, how we can use it to our help and that it creates
          an insight of what the user thinks of the product, how they feel and
          what they do about it. This provides us with the clues of how we can
          make a better product, how we can use this as an advantage to create
          or improve a completely new product.
          <br /><br />
          This helped me to learn that this is an essential step of the way of
          understanding the user’s problems and getting ideas on how to solve
          them and create something innovative.

        <h2>WEEK 3</h2>
        <p>
          In week 3, we had to do a research and target audience paper. I chose
          to do it for our client for the project. I had to create a survey, an
          ideal persona, deconstruct the market, a competitor analysis and an
          empathy map.
          <br /><br />
          What I have learnt in the process is that this is yet another crucial
          step for the process of creating an app that serves the users’ needs.
          This made me look more for the dfferences in each product, create a
          survey and an ideal persona. I also learnt how to sum up the
          information from the survey.

        <h2>WEEK 4</h2>
        <p>
          In week 4 we had to create an affinity map for R10 improvements.
          <br /><br />
          What I have learnt in the process is that affinity maps are very good
          for coming up with new ideas. We also did that in teams so my team
          working skills degfinitely improved and I believe that it is way
          better for a group of people to get together and give a lot of
          different ideas.

        <h2>WEEK 5</h2>
        <p>
          In week 5 we had to come up with a site of our own to make a task
          analysis to. I chose Bershka and I had to come up with the process of
          ordering something from Bershka.
          <br /><br />
          What I have learnt in the process is that the task analysis is the way
          to get an insight on what the user thinks. This is very crucial and
          has put me in the shoes of the user and to think what the process is.

        <h2>WEEK 12</h2>
        <p>
          In week 12 we had to create our own clickable prototype. I used Figma
          to create a prototype for a plant shop. This has been very interesting
          to me, as I had a lot of design ideas. I created the wireframes and
          started working on it.
          <br /><br />
          I learnt how to use diffetent tools for creating functional prototypes
          for a website, such as Figma, Adobe XD and Axure. I also learnt a lot
          of design principles and how to properly design a good looking
          webpage.

        <h2>WEEK 13</h2>
        <p>
          WEEK 13: In week 13 we had to conduct an interaction design
          comparison. I chose to do it for ZARA and ASOS.
          <br /><br />
          I leanrnt how two different products have completely different
          approaches even though they are in the same market. This has taught me
          also that we have to perfect eveything and fit it to the users’ needs.

        <h2>WEEK 15</h2>
        <p>
          WEEK 15: In week 15 we had to make a heuristic evaluation on an app of
          our choice. I decided to go with apple music as I think it has a lot
          of neat features and it stays within the established heuritics. <br />
          <br />
          I learnt the established heuristics that I used in the process of
          making my personal portfolio website.
